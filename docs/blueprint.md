## Core Features:

- Input Data Collection: User inputs the number of stations, helicopter capacity, and passenger information via an intuitive user interface.
- Optimization Engine: Leverages CP-SAT solver to compute optimized flight plans, considering station locations, helicopter capacity, and passenger priority. This feature acts as a 'tool', reasoning through different options to minimize travel.
- Plan Presentation: Displays 2+ alternative flight plans based on optimization results.
- Route Visualization: Visual route on a map-style layout
- Report Generation: Generates and exports .csv or .pdf reports detailing flight plans, passenger manifests, and efficiency metrics.
- Excel Data Import: Imports data from Excel files with a user-configurable structure to accommodate future format changes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#436964), suggesting competence, organization, and a sky-related vibe.
- Background color: Light gray (#E8C020), nearly the same hue as the primary blue, but extremely desaturated to keep a minimalistic appearance.
- Accent color: Complementary orange (#00EBD1) to highlight key CTAs and data points for quick user insight.
- Font: 'Inter', sans-serif. Suitable for clear data presentation.
- Simple and clear icons to represent stations, passengers, and actions (pickup, dropoff). Favor a consistent stroke weight.
- Prioritize data clarity, intuitive inputs, and an easy to interpret flight route visualization. Keep key metrics prominent.
